# Vercel Environment Variables Template
# Copy these environment variables to your Vercel project settings

# Database Connection String
# Required: PostgreSQL connection string for Drizzle ORM
DB_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require

# Node Environment
# Automatically set by Vercel, but can be overridden
NODE_ENV=production

# Port (not used in Vercel, but kept for local development compatibility)
PORT=5555

# Instructions for setting up environment variables in Vercel:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
# 3. Add the following variables:
#    - DB_URL: Your PostgreSQL connection string (with SSL certificate path if needed)
#    - NODE_ENV: production
# 4. Make sure to set the environment for: Production, Preview, and Development
# 5. Redeploy your application after setting environment variables

# Note about SSL Certificates:
# If your database requires SSL certificates (like the ca.pem file in certs/),
# you have two options:
# 1. Include the certificate in your deployment (not recommended for security)
# 2. Use connection string with sslmode=require without cert file path
# 3. Store certificate content in environment variable and write to /tmp at runtime
